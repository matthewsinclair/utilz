focus: "Post-compact pickup at 2026-09-08 18:40Z; the fold before it held. 2.8.0 released, tagged, published, CI green; ST0015 10/10 and ST0016 8/8 PASS. The .intentfiles saga is SOLVED: ST0015/ST0016 carried design.md and impl.md that were never ATTACHED to the store, so organize could never claim them and every dehydration left the directory behind. Four `intent st attach` calls took unclaimed 4 -> 0 and ST0015 pruned cleanly. Nothing claimed, nothing held, inboxes empty. Every remaining TODO is an hv policy call. Awaiting hv."

# Validation Claude (vc)

Validation node. cc builds, vc contracts and verifies, hv adjudicates. Full boards for 8 Sep are in `.history/20260908/` -- FOLD 5 holds the 32006-byte pre-compression original. This board keeps ONE statement of each rule with the instance that earned it, not the day's narrative.

## DOING

**Nothing. Folded at 2026-09-08 17:46Z on hv's instruction; the compact has since happened and this board is what carried across.** Status stays `active` -- a compact is not a session ending.

## TODO

- **`.intentfiles` header is the root of an entire wasted afternoon and is still wrong.** It is the hand-written 2026-08-26 original -- "organize --default was not yet built" -- and names `st hydrate` **zero times**. Four of us hunted a verb the file said nothing about. The current Intent template names it and lists every writer. hv's to refresh.
- **ST0016 is still hydrated** and `.intentfiles` declares a Completed thread while the header says only OPEN ones are. Either `organize --apply` finishes it as ST0015 was finished, or the policy changed and the header should say so. hv's call, unblocked now that nothing is unclaimed.
- **Issue 0011** -- `install_guards.bats` reads a live `git rev-parse HEAD` against a fixture-time install. One-line fix, unclaimed, the only open medium.
- **Issues 0010 and 0007** -- absolute home paths in eight READMEs; prez slide-counter contrast. Both low.
- **0013's honest scope limit** is unrecorded: it closed the ONE write-only capture, not the class. The other 15 are needle-read, so a NEW unexpected warning at any of them still goes unread.
- **AC16 catalogue placement** -- rendered and eyeballed, never filed anywhere.
- **The closed-thread evidence gap** -- Intent's, via `intent-vc`.

## Claims

- **None.**

## Holds

- **None.**

## Open with hv

- The two `.intentfiles` items above, which are one decision.
- Whether `--help` diverging on a DIRECTLY executed utility is worth a thread. cc reported it and correctly did not fold it into ST0016.

## Live with other nodes

- **`cc`: folded for a compact, status active, nothing claimed.** Built ST0013, ST0015 and ST0016 today against contracts I wrote.
- **`intent-vc`: three Intent issues from this estate today** -- 0282 (ws hygiene thresholded the wrong bytes, FIXED), 0283 (a closed thread's view goes stale and both messages misdescribe it), 0284 (27 leaked `intentd`, high, cleared).

## Watch-outs

**FIND THE RECORD BEFORE FORMING THE HYPOTHESIS. THIS IS THE BIGGEST MISS OF THE DAY AND IT IS MINE.** Files were vanishing from `intent/st/`. I theorised through git hooks, `intent doctor`, an unnamed concurrent writer, and finally 27 leaked `intentd` daemons -- which I ESCALATED TO hv AS THE ROOT CAUSE. It was none of them. `intent/.cache/intent.db` holds an `event_log` table naming every disk mutation with a timestamp, and an `attachments` table that showed the actual defect. **Two `sqlite3` queries would have ended it before the first theory.** A real anomaly is not automatically YOUR anomaly: the daemon leak was genuine and unrelated, and I attached my symptoms to it because it was the only strange thing in view.

**A POPULATION IS THE CLAIM, NOT A DETAIL OF IT.** Six ways it went wrong in one day: TOO WIDE fails loudly (36 tools in `~/.local/bin` when 15 are ours, 42 spurious failures, one minute); TOO NARROW fails greenly and ships (a control over 16 of 33 files); SELF-MATCHING fails silently and forever (`pgrep -f 'utilz test'` matching the waiter -- fix is `utilz[ ]test`); PATTERN-MATCHES-PROSE has no bound at all (`bats ` hit another project's SYSTEM PROMPT; `escape` matched a CSS comment; `session` matched ordinary commit text); DEFINED BY AUTHORSHIP misses other writers' commits; and FIXED AT INVOCATION measures a tree that moved (`bats ./*.bats` expands once -- eleven new tests silently excluded, total unchanged at 554, byte-identical to "they ran and added nothing").

**A COUNT CONTROL AND A SUM CONTROL CATCH DIFFERENT FAILURES, ONE SUBTRACTION APART.** A sweep prints its population and refuses at ZERO -- catches an empty population, where "no matches" and "no problems" are the same output. A partition prints its REMAINDER and refuses when the parts do not sum -- catches a wrongly decomposed one. Only the second caught my four categories summing to 66 against my own stated total of 74. **A partition that does not sum to its own total is self-refuting before anyone else looks at it.**

**AN ABSENCE ASSERTION NEEDS A PRESENCE ASSERTION OVER THE SAME POPULATION, OR IT IS A SUBSET CHECK WEARING THE COSTUME OF THE FIX.** Deleting every line satisfies an assert-absence exactly as well as fixing it does. Pairing them is necessary and NOT sufficient: the pair must consume ONE population, computed once.

**PROVE IT RED AGAINST THE REAL DEFECT, AND GATE THE PROOF ON THE DEFECT BEING PRESENT.** A green never observed to fail is `IN-AG-RED-CONTROL-001`. Best fixtures cost nothing: a stale published install red-proved AT09 at 28 failures; the pre-fix deck red-proved AT03's capture at 165 bytes. **My first injection silently did not apply** -- the anchor occurred twice, once inside a fenced example -- and I ran the suite anyway and read the resulting green as a result. Only the rewrite's own `count == 1` refusal caught it.

**A CHECK THAT READS A SOURCE WHICH HAS STOPPED CHANGING KEEPS RETURNING THE RIGHT ANSWER LONG AFTER THE CHECK ITSELF HAS DIED.** cc's hung suite watcher printed `ok=554 notok=0`, matching its log exactly, and cited that as proof of completion. It had been sleeping 21 minutes past the suite's end; the harness timed it out and the write flushed on termination. **A hung monitor and a working monitor emit byte-identical output.** Read the timestamp, not just the value.

**THE INSTRUMENT IS PART OF THE CLAIM, AND A CLEAN ZERO IS THE COMMONEST LIE.** `git grep -E` does not honour `\b` and matches nothing rather than saying so (0 vs 2 vs 2 on one file). `bash -n` cannot parse a `.bats` file and blamed a pre-existing line for my new code. `mapfile` is bash 4 against a 3.2.57 `/bin/bash`. Manifest paths are repo-root-relative -- I hashed **zero** files from the wrong cwd and reported `mismatches=0`, twice, months apart. **A zero from something you did not mean to invoke is the reading your own authorship makes you LEAST likely to question.**

**THE ARTIFACT OUTRANKS THE SOURCE; THE SOURCE ONLY FEELS AUTHORITATIVE BECAUSE IT IS CAUSAL.** cc reasoned about a 1226-line log from one line of its source and concluded two suites were indistinguishable; line 811 prints the script path and the log carried both. Where an artifact exists, read the artifact.

**A STALE BINDING IS WORSE THAN A STALE VALUE, AND ITS TELL IS TWO CORRECT SENTENCES THAT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER.** "Your last write", "the latest", "current HEAD", "now" all resolve at READ time. cc and I each staled our own unpushed figure with our own commit, minutes apart, while discussing staleness. **Quote the command, not the number -- and where you must quote a number about a thing you are also changing, measure AFTER your last write. Otherwise you are the decay.**

**NEAR-AGREEMENT SUPPRESSES THE CHECK THAT DISAGREEMENT WOULD FORCE, AND IT TAKES BOTH PARTIES.** Twice today. Two counts one apart (45 vs 44) made a false reconciliation feel obvious; the truth was 78 and 1-of-16. And on the `glow` hang: mine "the pager breaks scripts", cc's "the pager is inert because stdout redirects" -- **both wrong about the pager, with the real defect (stdin) underneath the thing we were both arguing about.** We would have shipped agreeing.

**WHEN TWO NODES VERIFY ONE CHANGE, AGREEING ON THE INSTRUMENT WASTES ONE OF THEM.** Pick the claim the other did not make. cc verified every utility ANSWERS a version; I verified the answer EQUALS the bytes of its single home. Two numbers agreeing by luck pass the first and fail the second.

**KNOWING A RULE IS MEASURABLY NOT THE SAME AS BEING PROTECTED BY IT, SO THE GUARD BELONGS IN THE CODE.** Four instances in one day, each committed by someone who had written the rule down. **Where knowing demonstrably does not prevent the error, build the guard into the output** -- cc printed a local-time column under a literal `DO-NOT-TRUST` header rather than trusting themselves to recall which column was which.

**AN ASSERTION WEAK ENOUGH TO BE SATISFIED BY PROSE SPLITS A UNIFORM CHANGE INTO RED AND GREEN FOR UNRELATED REASONS.** Ten bats tests asserted the bare letter `"v"`; a change that rewrote every one of those lines turned only five red, because `stampz` and `lnrel` have a v in "every" and "relative". Where the SHAPE of a message is the requirement, the row must say the shape -- a substring check cannot see a malformed string that contains the substring.

**A ROW MAY BE CORRECTED TO ITS INTENT; IT MAY NEVER BE WEAKENED TO FIT AN IMPLEMENTATION.** The test is whether the intent held BEFORE the edit. AC07 said "redirect on every renderer arm"; three arms exist and `cat FILE` provably cannot block (exit 0 immediately vs exit 124 for bare `cat`), so the letter demanded a token that protects nothing and teaches a false lesson. Reworded to the property, exemption stated as measured.

**PROSE DOES NOT FAIL, SO A JUDGEMENT WORTH KEEPING NEEDS A ROW.** cc's D4 -- ST0016 keeps the `--help` arms that ST0015 deleted -- lived only in a design document. Two adjacent threads are exactly what a later reader flattens into one pattern. AC06 made the restraint enforceable.

**A CI LEG YOUR PLATFORM CANNOT REACH IS A BRANCH YOU HAVE NOT TESTED.** `macoz` guards on `uname != Darwin` before its arg loop, so `macoz --help` has never worked on Linux; my AC06 asserted platform-independent behaviour of a platform-specific utility. **Then my fix for that introduced the second failure**: an assignment from a command substitution takes that command's status, and under `set -e` it aborts THAT LINE before any `rc=$?` -- `|| rc=$?` is the fix. I had noted the branch was untested and pushed anyway. **A control over the pattern is not a control over the code path that uses it.**

**A REAL FINDING IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY YOUR FINDING, AND A FLAKE IS NOT A REGRESSION.** Before re-running a red CI job I checked: the Rust leg had passed in the three previous runs, and the commit touched one bats file that leg never reads. Re-run: green, same commit. **Establish that a failure is caused by your change before treating it as one, and that it is not before dismissing it.**

**THE ESTATE, MEASURED TODAY.** `utilz` on PATH is whichever tree `utilz use` last pointed at -- **run the command, never carry the answer**; the provenance line exists so that costs one command, and it earned itself twice. `utilz test` is not concurrency-safe. **`show_help` closes the renderer's stdin now**: a bare `glow FILE` with a terminal on stdin hangs (exit 124 under `timeout 5`, once killed at 120s), and it is NOT the pager -- `-p` is opt-in and it hangs without it. The hang was never reproduced under a `script`-allocated pty, so the guard is asserted PRESENT rather than the hang claimed fixed. **A part-compiled tool's `--version` answers for one half and is confidently wrong about the other**: `intent --version` reported a commit predating a fix that was live, because that path is a shell script read from source. Ask the behaviour.

**INTENT'S OWN VERBS, LEARNED THE EXPENSIVE WAY.** `intent st hydrate <ID>` adds a thread to `.intentfiles` and writes its files; `st dehydrate` is its inverse; **`st attach <ID> <path> --from <file>` puts an AUTHORED doc into the store, and until you do, `organize` reports it `unclaimed` and can never remove it -- which is why a closed thread's directory survives every dehydration.** `organize --apply` is a whole-tree reconcile that REMOVES; never point it at a tree whose declaration is unsettled. `intent edit st <ID> --path` writes a declaration as a SIDE EFFECT of printing a path. `sync --to-disk` syncs the store with the canon extract and does NOT regenerate views. **`intent/.cache/` is gitignored -- an attachment living only there is lost on a fresh clone; verify it reached `intent/.canon/` before deleting any file it claims to hold.**

## Decisions that still decide things

- (2026-09-08) **hv: no `v` in any version string, anywhere, including the git tag.** `utilz:2.8.0` solo, `utilz:2.8.0/<util>:<version>` paired. Historical prose and quoted cargo output are records of what something WAS and are left alone; `docs/developer-guide.md` was teaching the v-form and was fixed, because a doc that teaches it re-seeds it. Nothing in this repo globs `v*`, so the non-uniform tag series costs a reader's eye and nothing else -- measured, and hv accepted it twice.
- (2026-09-08) **A closed thread's contract may gain a row, and the gate going BLOCKED is the thread admitting it closed incomplete.** ST0016 went 7/7 PASS to 7/8 BLOCKED when AC08 landed, and back to 8/8 when its test did. Not a regression; the honest signal.
- (2026-09-08) **AC03 stays with the thread that paid for it** -- hv's ruling: a thread's cost of proof belongs to that thread, even when the proof is built somewhere the title does not name.
- (2026-09-07) **THE VARIABLE IS NOT THE DEFECT; THE SILENCE IS.** Ruled against my own prior recommendation.
- (2026-09-07) **NEVER IMPLICITLY, ALWAYS AVAILABLE EXPLICITLY.** AC11 and AC16 are one policy from two sides.
- (2026-08-29) **Two checks measuring the same PROPERTY by different mechanisms are duplication; two measuring DIFFERENT properties are not.**
- (2026-08-29) **A criterion pins properties, not enumerations.**
- (2026-08-29) **No fallback message names as its remedy the case in which it fired.**
