# Tasks - ST0002: Syncz - a simple directory-to-directory syncer

## Tasks

- [x] WP01: Steel thread docs & scaffolding
- [x] WP02: Core sync implementation
- [x] WP03: Confirmation & summary
- [x] WP04: Conflict resolution & extra features
- [x] WP05: Tests
- [x] WP06: Documentation & CI

## Task Notes

WP01-04 are implemented together as a single syncz script since the functions are tightly coupled. WP05 and WP06 are separate deliverables.

## Dependencies

- WP01 must complete before WP02-04 (need scaffold)
- WP02-04 must complete before WP05 (need implementation to test)
- WP05-06 can be done in parallel
