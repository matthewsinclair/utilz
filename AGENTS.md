# AGENTS.md

This is the primary tool-agnostic config file for AI coding agents working on this project. Every major agentic CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Aider, Continue, Cline, Gemini CLI) reads AGENTS.md as the canonical project contract. Spec: https://agents.md.

## Project Overview

Utilz -- an Intent project. See `CLAUDE.md` for Claude-specific overlay.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Bash 4.0+, POSIX-compliant shell

### Setup

```bash
intent doctor     # verify Intent configuration
```

## Build and Test Commands

### Testing

_No automated tests configured yet._

### Building

_No build step required._

### Validation

```bash
intent doctor       # check Intent configuration
intent st list      # list steel threads
```

## Code Style

- Shell scripts: 2-space indentation, POSIX-compliant where practical.
- Markdown: no manual line wrapping; verblock frontmatter on persistent docs.
- See `usage-rules.md` for the terse "DO / NEVER" contract.
- See `intent/docs/working-with-llms.md` for the canon tech note on the LLM-facing layout and how hooks + critics + skills compose.

## Steel Thread + Work Package Process

Work is organised into numbered **steel threads** (`ST####`), each containing **work packages** (`WP`). Every steel thread has its own directory under `intent/st/<ID>/` with `info.md` as the entry point.

```bash
intent st list               # list steel threads
intent st new "Title"        # create new
intent st show <id>          # inspect
intent wp list <STID>        # list work packages
intent wp new <STID> "..."   # create work package
intent wp start <STID/NN>    # mark WIP
intent wp done <STID/NN>     # mark done
```

Never create steel thread or work package directories by hand -- always use the CLI.

## Installed Skills

_No skills installed. Run `intent claude skills list` to see available skills._

## Installed Subagents

_No subagents installed. Run `intent claude subagents list` to see available subagents._

## Critic Family

Per-language rule enforcement via thin subagents that read the rule library at invocation time. Available: `critic-elixir`, `critic-rust`, `critic-swift`, `critic-lua`, `critic-shell`. Invoke:

```
Task(subagent_type="critic-<lang>", prompt="review <targets>")
```

A headless runner at `bin/intent_critic` (Greppable-proxy rules only; no LLM required) powers the pre-commit gate. Contract: `intent/docs/critics.md`. Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings, `2` error.

## Rule Library

All coding rules live in `intent/plugins/claude/rules/`. Each rule is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter, a Detection heuristic, and bad/good examples. Skills cite rule IDs; critics enforce them.

```bash
intent claude rules list        # enumerate
intent claude rules show <id>   # inspect
intent claude rules validate    # schema check
```

## Extensions

User extensions live at `~/.intent/ext/<name>/` and contribute subagents, skills, or rule packs without modifying canon. Reference extension: `worker-bee`.

```bash
intent ext list
intent ext show <name>
intent ext new <name>
```

Authoring guide: `intent/docs/writing-extensions.md`.

## Session Hooks

`.claude/settings.json` wires three Claude Code lifecycle hooks: **SessionStart** (inject context + `/in-session` reminder), **UserPromptSubmit** (strict gate -- block first prompt until `/in-session` runs), **Stop** (remind `/in-finish` at wrap-up). Full architecture: `intent/docs/working-with-llms.md#session-hook-architecture`.

## Socrates vs Diogenes FAQ

Two distinct subagents for two distinct concerns:

- **Socrates** -- CTO Review Mode. Architectural and strategic technical decision-making via Socratic dialog.
- **Diogenes** -- Elixir Test Architect. Test-specification generation and gap analysis.

They have never been the same agent. FAQ + forensic detail: `intent/docs/working-with-llms.md#socrates-vs-diogenes-faq`.

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the test suite before making changes -- establish a baseline.
2. Make changes.
3. Run the suite again; confirm no regressions.
4. Add new tests for new functionality.
5. Before commit, the pre-commit critic gate checks staged files for `CRITICAL` + `WARNING` findings. See `intent/docs/pre-commit-hook.md`.

## Commit Guidelines

- Descriptive commit messages; reference steel thread or work package IDs where applicable.
- No AI attribution in commit messages (no `Co-Authored-By`, no tool signatures).
- Small, coherent commits preferred over large batches.

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- Review external inputs for injection-class bugs.
- Follow the project's security policy if one exists.
